## Problem

As a biologist, one daily work is comparing the treatment and untreatment group and find if there are any significant difference. One common way is drawing a barplot with error bar and put the significant letters  a little higher than the bar plot. Like a figure showing below:
annotations for significant differences based on p value.

Results are usually drawn in a barplot. For all variables with the same letter, the difference between the means is not statistically significant. If two variables have different letters, they are significantly different.

But draw this graph in ggplot are not easy. This post will solve this problem.

## Solution

### prepare data

```{r}
x<-c(25.6,22.2,28.0,29.8,24.4,30.0,29.0,27.5,25.0,27.7,23.0,32.2,28.8,28.0,31.5,25.9,20.6,21.2,22.0,21.2) 
b<-data.frame(x,a=gl(5,4,20)) ## a is factor

head(b)
```

### anova test and Tukey multiple comparisons

```{r}
m1<-aov(x~a,data=b)
TukeyHSD(m1)
```

`TukeyHSD` means Tukey's ‘Honest Significant Difference’ method which create a set of confidence intervals on the differences between the means of the levels of a factor with the specified family-wise probability of coverage. From the result, only 5 and 2, 5 and 4 have significantly different.

### HSD.test mutiple comparisons

```{r}
library(agricolae)
results <- HSD.test(m1, "a", group=TRUE)
results$groups

oder.group <- results$groups[order(rownames(results$groups)),]
```
Using `HSD.test` function, we can assign our group to significant letters, the default significant level is 0.05.


### Creat barplot with error bar and significant letters.

```{r}
library(Rmisc)
stats <- summarySE(b, measurevar="x", groupvars=c("a"),na.rm=TRUE)
stats
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(stats, aes(x=a, y=x)) + 
  geom_bar(position=position_dodge(.5), stat="identity",
             colour="black", width = 0.5) +      # Change bar size with width = 0.5
    geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=x-se, ymax=x+se),
                  size=.5,    # Thinner lines
                  width=.2,
                  position=position_dodge(.5)) + 
  theme_classic() + geom_text(aes(x=a, y=x+se+2,label=oder.group$groups), position=position_dodge(width=0.9), size=4)#text(x = stats$a, y = stats$x+stats$se+5, labels = c("ab", "a", "ab", "a", "b"))
```

For the graph above, we know only 5 have significant difference with 2 and 4.
