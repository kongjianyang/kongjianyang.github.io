# 1. OO (Object-oriented) field guide

R has four object oriented systems:

  - base type: are mostly manipulated using C code 
  - S3 type: S3 is a very casual system. It has no formal definition of classes.
  - S4 type: S4 has formal class definitions and multiple dispatch 
  - RC (Reference Classes) type

A class defines the behaviour of objects by describing their attributes and their relationship to other classes.

`pryr` provides tools to pry back the surface of R and dig into the details. 

## Base types
new base types are added very rarely. determine the object’s base type with typeof(). 

```{r}
# The type of a function is "closure"
f <- function() {}
typeof(f)
is.function(f)
# The type of a primitive function is "builtin"
typeof(sum)
is.primitive(sum)
```

Functions for different base types are almost always written in C. S3 objects can be built on top of any base type, S4 objects use a special base type, and RC objects are a combination of S4 and environments. 

To see if an object is a pure base type, check that is.object(x) returns FALSE.

if the object x has the R internal OBJECT, the `is.object()` return True
```{r}
is.object(f)
is.object(1) # FALSE
is.object(as.factor(1:3)) # TRUE
```

## S3 type 

S3 is the only OO system used in the base and stats packages.

`pryr::otype():` can be used to test if an object is an S3 object in base R.

```{r}
library(pryr)

df <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = letters[1:10])
otype(df)    # A data frame is an S3 class
otype(df$x)  # A numeric vector isn't
otype(df$y)  # A factor is
```

In S3, methods belong to functions, called generic functions. S3 methods do not belong to objects or classes. 

`ftype()` can describes the object system and to determinate if a function is an S3 method or generic:

```{r}
ftype(mean)
ftype(t.data.frame) # data frame method for t()
ftype(t.test)       # generic function for t tests
```

### Defining classes and creating objects

```{r}
# Create and assign class in one step
foo <- structure(list(), class = "foo")
# ftype(foo)
# Create, then set class
foo <- list()
class(foo) <- "foo"
foo
```

determine the class of any object using `class(x)`, and see if an object inherits from a specific class using `inherits(x, "classname")`.

```{r}
class(foo)
inherits(foo, "foo")
```

<img src="https://snag.gy/fQLdeK.jpg" width= "200" height = "200" align=center/>

we can change the class of existing objects:



### Creating new methods and generics

To add a new generic, just need to create a function that calls UseMethod(). 

```{r}
f <- function(x) UseMethod("f")
f.a <- function(x) "Class a"
f.b <- function(x) "Class b"
a <- structure(list(), class = "a")
class(a)
f(a)
f.a(a)
f.b(a)
b <- structure(list(), class = "b")
class(b)
f(b)
f.a(b)
f.b(b)
```


```{r}
f <- function(x) UseMethod("f")
f.a <- function(x) "Class a"
f.default <- function(x) "Unknown class"

# Method for a class
f(structure(list(), class = "a"))

# No method for b class, so uses method for a class
f(structure(list(), class = c("b", "a")))

# No method for c class, so falls back to default
f(structure(list(), class = "c"))

# Force R to call the wrong method, f.a should only use for a class
f.a(structure(list(), class = "c"))
```

## S4 type

- Classes have formal definitions which describe their fields and inheritance structures (parent classes).

- Method dispatch can be based on multiple arguments to a generic function

- There is a special operator, @, for extracting slots from an S4 object.

### Recognising objects, generic functions, and methods

No S4 classes in the base packages 

```{r}
library(stats4)

# From example(mle)
y <- c(26, 17, 13, 12, 20, 5, 9, 8, 5, 4, 8)
nLL <- function(lambda) - sum(dpois(y, lambda, log = TRUE))
fit <- mle(nLL, start = list(lambda = 5), nobs = length(y))

# An S4 object
isS4(fit)
otype(fit)
ftype(nobs)
# nobs is a function to extract the number of observations from a Fit.
```

### Defining classes and creating objects

An S4 class has three key properties:

- A name: an alpha-numeric class identifier. 
- A named list of slots (fields), which defines slot names and permitted classes.
- A string giving the class it inherits from, or, in S4 terminology, that it contains.

```{r}
setClass("Person",
  slots = list(name = "character", age = "numeric"))
setClass("Employee",
  slots = list(boss = "Person"),
  contains = "Person")

alice <- new("Person", name = "Alice", age = 40)
john <- new("Employee", name = "John", age = 20, boss = alice)
```

```{r}
alice
alice@name
```

```{r}
john@boss; slot(john, "boss")
```

`(@ is equivalent to $, and slot() to [[.) but the $ and slot() doesn't work for S4`

```{r}
# john$boss
```
 
### Creating new methods and generics

we could take union(), which usually just works on vectors, and make it work with data frames:

```{r}
alist <- c("a", "b", "a")
blist <- c("a", "c", "d")
union(alist, blist)
```

```{r}
x <- data.frame("SN" = 1:2, "Age" = c(21,15), "Name" = c("John","Dora"))
y <- data.frame("SN" = 1:2, "Age" = c(21,15), "Name" = c("John","Alice"))
union(x, y)
```


```{r}
setGeneric("union")

setMethod("union",
  c(x = "data.frame", y = "data.frame"),
  function(x, y) {
    unique(rbind(x, y))
  }
)
```

```{r}
union(x, y)
```

# 2. Environments

## Environment basics

an environment serve as a bag of names: Each name points to an object stored in memory:

```{r}
e <- new.env()
e$a <- FALSE
e$b <- "a"
e$c <- 2.3
e$d <- 1:3
ls(e) # show all object in the environment
```

multiple names can point to the same object, Every environment has a parent, another environment. 

an environment is similar to a list, with four important exceptions:

- Every name in an environment is unique.

- The names in an environment are not ordered (i.e., it doesn’t make sense to ask what the first element of an environment is).

- An environment has a parent.

- Environments have reference semantics.

four special environments: 

-  globalenv(), or global environment, is the interactive workspace. This is the environment in which you normally work. 

- baseenv(), or base environment, is the environment of the base package. Its parent is the empty environment.

- emptyenv(), or empty environment, is the ultimate ancestor of all environments

- environment() is the current environment.

search() lists all parents of the global environment.

```{r}
search()
```

Autoloads is used to save memory by only loading package objects

use new.env() to create an environment, use parent.env() to see its parent

```{r}
e <- new.env()
# the default parent provided by new.env() is environment
parent.env(e)
e$a <- 1
e$b <- 2
ls(e)
```

```{r}
e$a
```

useful way to view an environment is ls.str()

```{r}
ls.str(e)
```

extract the value from a name

```{r}
e$a; e[["a"]]; get("a", envir = e)
```

use rm() to remove the binding.

```{r}
rm("a", envir = e)
ls.str(e)
```

use exists() to determine if a variable in an environment

```{r}
x <- 10
exists("x", envir = e)
identical(globalenv(), environment())
```

## Recursing over environments

where() finds the environment where that name is defined, using R’s regular scoping rules:

```{r}
library(pryr)
x <- 5
where("x")

where("mean")
```

definition of where()

```{r}
where
```



<table><tr><td bgcolor=orange><font color=gray size=7>Not Interesting</font></td></tr></table>

## Explicit environments

the original list is not changed because modifying a list actually creates and modifies a copy.

```{r}
modify <- function(x) {
  x$a <- 2
  invisible()
}
```

```{r}
x_l <- list()
x_l$a <- 1
modify(x_l)
x_l$a
```

apply it to an environment, the original environment is modified:

```{r}
x_e <- new.env()
x_e$a <- 1
modify(x_e)
x_e$a
```

# 3. Functional programming

R is a functional programming (FP) language.

three building blocks of functional programming

- anonymous functions
- closures (functions written by functions)
- lists of functions.

```{r}
# Generate a sample dataset
set.seed(1014)
df <- data.frame(replicate(6, sample(c(1:10, -99), 6, rep = TRUE)))
names(df) <- letters[1:6]
df
```


```{r}
fix_missing <- function(x) {
  x[x == -99] <- NA
  x
}
df[] <- lapply(df, fix_missing)
df
```

code have more advantages

## Anonymous functions

```{r}
# the anonymous function is same
(function(x) x + 3)(10)
f <- function(x) x + 3
f(10)
```


## Closures

closure have two 

```{r}

# two variable inside
power <- function(exponent) {
  function(x) {
    x ^ exponent
  }
}

square <- power(2) # exponent is 2 
square(3) # x is 3
```

print a closure, can see anything useful:

```{r}
square
```

the function itself doesn’t change, the difference is the enclosing environment

```{r}
environment(square) %>% as.list()
```

another way to see the structure

```{r}
library(pryr)
unenclose(square)
```


`<<-` the double arrow operator will keep looking up the chain of parent environments until it finds a matching name

```{r}
new_counter <- function() {
  i <- 0
  function() {
    i <<- i + 1
    i
  }
}

counter_one <- new_counter()
unenclose(counter_one)
counter_one()
unenclose(counter_one)
counter_one()
```

## Lists of functions

functions can be stored in lists.

```{r}
compute_mean <- list(
  base = function(x) mean(x),
  sum = function(x) sum(x) / length(x),
  manual = function(x) {
    total <- 0
    n <- length(x)
    for (i in seq_along(x)) {
      total <- total + x[i] / n
    }
    total
  }
)
```

to call each function use lapply() and need an anonymous function or a new named function,

```{r}
x <- runif(1e5) # return a uniform distribution data
lapply(compute_mean, function(f) f(x))
```

```{r}
lapply(compute_mean, function(f) system.time(f(x)))
```


```{r}
x <- 1:10
funs <- list(
  sum = sum,
  mean = mean,
  median = median
)
lapply(funs, function(f) f(x))
```


```{r}
# put a function in the aggrement of a function
midpoint <- function(f, a, b) {
  (b - a) * f((a + b) / 2)
}

trapezoid <- function(f, a, b) {
  (b - a) / 2 * (f(a) + f(b))
}

midpoint(sin, 0, pi)

trapezoid(sin, 0, pi)
```

# 4. Functionals

A higher-order function is a function that takes a function as an input or returns a function as output. The complement to a closure is a functional

```{r}
randomise <- function(f) f(runif(1e3)) # f is a function as input
randomise(mean)
```

lapply() takes a function, applies it to each element in a list, and returns the results in the form of a list. 

```{r}
lapply2 <- function(x, f, ...) {
  out <- vector("list", length(x))
  for (i in seq_along(x)) {
    out[[i]] <- f(x[[i]], ...)
  }
  out
}

# Create some random data
l <- replicate(20, runif(sample(1:10, 1)), simplify = FALSE)

# With lapply
unlist(lapply(l, length))
```


```{r}
# What class is each column?
unlist(lapply(mtcars, class))
```

```{r}
# rcauchy return a cauchy distribution
trims <- c(0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5)
x <- rcauchy(1000)
unlist(lapply(trims, function(trim) mean(x, trim = trim)))
```

## sapply and vapply

vapply() takes an additional argument specifying the output type.

```{r}
sapply(mtcars, is.numeric)
args(vapply)
```

```{r}
vapply(mtcars, is.numeric, FUN.VALUE = logical(1))
```

```{r}
df <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = letters[1:10])
sapply(df, class)
```

```{r}
vapply(df, class, character(1))
```

```{r}
df2 <- data.frame(x = 1:10, y = Sys.time() + 1:10)
sapply(df2, class)
```

## Multiple inputs: Map (and mapply)

```{r}
# Generate some sample data
xs <- replicate(5, runif(10), simplify = FALSE)
ws <- replicate(5, rpois(10, 5) + 1, simplify = FALSE)
```

compute the unweighted means:

```{r}
sapply(xs, mean)
```

calculate weighted.mean()

```{r}
unlist(lapply(seq_along(xs), function(i) {
  weighted.mean(xs[[i]], ws[[i]])
}))
# or 
unlist(lapply(1:5, function(i) {
  weighted.mean(xs[[i]], ws[[i]])
}))
```

Map, a variant of lapply()

```{r}
Map(weighted.mean, xs, ws)  %>% unlist() # Map(f, ...)
```

```{r}
a <- matrix(1:20, nrow = 5)
apply(a, 1, mean)
```

## Function operators

```{r}
chatty <- function(f) {
  function(x, ...) {
    res <- f(x, ...)
    cat("Processing ", x, "\n", sep = "")
    res
  }
}
f <- function(x) x ^ 2
s <- c(3, 2, 1)
chatty(f)(1)
```

```{r}
vapply(s, chatty(f), numeric(1))
```
